 * The `pop {r0}` fixes THIS function as void: it overwrites whatever
 * the callee returned, so nothing about the callee is visible from
 * here. Everything below was read off the callee's own body instead.
 *
 * The callee reads no argument register before writing it, so there
 * is no parameter to pass through either.

 * Two statements and not `g(f())`: the second callee takes no arguments (it
 * opens with a `bl`, a pool `ldr` or a `movs` into r0, never a read of r0),
 * so there is no parameter for the first call's result to reach. `g(f())`
 * would be byte-identical only if `g` had a parameter, and none of the 19
 * second callees does -- see the F005 block in unknown-functions.h. */
